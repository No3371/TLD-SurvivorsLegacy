# Survivor's Legacy

> Take my stuff with you...

> Survive.

This a mod for the game The Long Dark. It enables a minimal way for players to interact with each toher.

When your character die in the game, the mod sends your legacy to a http channel (thanks to patchbay.pub).

A legacy contains:
- Three random items on you
- How many days you survived 
- Your ingame general note

The sending operation stops when:
- You close the game (of course, it's not rumning anymore)
- The data is sent
- You die again

On the other hand, when you enter a region you will receive others' legacy when all these conditions are met:
- There is unsearched corpse in the region
- You have not received any legacy in the region
- Another player who died in this region is posting their legacy

The received legacy will be inserted into a random unsearched corpse. When you get up close, you will see:
- How many days does the legacy sender survived
- The content of his ingame general note. If it's empty, it will be replaced with general text.

And the legacy items can be found on the corpse.
